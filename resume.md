## **Experience**

### **Software Engineer – MSD** <span style="float:right;">Jan 2024 — Present</span>

Engineered and scaled the Python/FastAPI backend of an enterprise-grade multimodal LLM assistant serving 35,000+ monthly users across 100+ countries and 15 global divisions, enabling GenAI-powered productivity, automation, and decision support across the organisation.

- Led the design of an orchestration framework integrating web search, document retrieval, and image processing in a unified chat interface, simplifying user interaction and improving response quality over legacy workflows, leading to a **15% increase in average monthly user activity**.
- Implemented a feedback mechanism for LLM-generated responses, capturing **2,000+ user inputs** that informed product quality analysis and guided roadmap decisions.
- Facilitated infrastructure migration from Amazon EC2 to EKS, enabling a scalable microservice architecture that improved system reliability and reduced **infrastructure costs by 20%** through Fargate serverless integration.
- Built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated testing, vulnerability scanning, and Kubernetes deployment; maintaining **80%+ test coverage** and meeting monthly release targets.
- Developed a proof-of-concept integration of internal news feeds and technical documentation into the LLM assistant, laying the foundation for enterprise knowledge retrieval from proprietary data sources.
- Integrated OpenTelemetry into backend services to improve observability and reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) for performance and reliability issues.

Built and maintained a full-stack enterprise URL shortening and management tool with React, powering **14,000+ registered links** across **3,400+ users**, and improving link governance, campaign tracking, and stakeholder visibility.

- Engineered comprehensive features that enhanced platform functionality and user experience, including secondary link ownership, ownership transfer, and advanced keyword search capabilities.
- Integrated customisable QR code generation for short links, featuring logo uploads, colour theming, and size adjustments, leading to greater adoption by marketing teams and increased campaign-tracking usage.

### **Cloud Engineer – MSD** <span style="float:right;">Jul 2023 — Dec 2023</span>

- Architected and implemented cloud automations mapping **95%+ of cloud resource cost** to company applications, generating targeted cost-optimisation reports and automated alerts for untagged resources, promoting enterprise-wide accountability.
- Developed **AWS QuickSight dashboards** through SQL data manipulation, uncovering **US $1.3 M in monthly savings opportunities**, enhancing cost visibility and driving targeted optimisation initiatives.
